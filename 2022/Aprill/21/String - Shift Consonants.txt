String - Shift Consonants
The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must shift the consonants to the left by 1 position in the string S. Then the program must print the revised string as the output.

Note: At least one consonant is always present in the string S.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Gujarat

Output:
jurataG

Explanation:
Here S = Gujarat.
The consonants in the string S are G, j, r, and t.
After shifting the consonants to the left by 1 position, the string S becomes jurataG.
So jurataG is printed as the output.
