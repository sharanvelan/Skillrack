String - Remove Minimum Characters
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the minimum number of characters to be removed from the string S so that the length of the revised string must be even(possibly 0) also every two consecutive characters(non-overlapping) must be different.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the minimum number of characters to be removed from S.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
coffee

Output:
2

Explanation:
Here S = coffee.The minimum number of characters to be removed from the string is 2.
coffee -> cofeThe length of the revised string is 4 which is even and every two consecutive characters are different.
Hence 2 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
dddeeeeddd
Output:
6

Explanation:
Here S = dddeeeeddd.
The minimum number of characters to be removed from the string is 6.
dddeeeeddd -> deedThe length of the revised string is 4 which is even and every two consecutive characters are different.
Hence 6 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
grapes
Output:
0
Example Input/Output 4:

Input:
aabbaaabbbc

Output:
3
