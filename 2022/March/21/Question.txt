Function Remove Reversed Words

The function/method removeReversedWords accepts two arguments str1 and str2 representing two string values. 
The string str1 contains multiple words separated by a space. The string str2 contains exactly one word.
The function/method removeReversedWords must remove all the occurrences of the word str2 and its reverse in the string str1. 
Then the function must return the revised string as a new string. If the string becomes empty, then the function must return -1 as a string.
Your task is to implement the function removeReversedWords so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.
