Find Area - Radius or Diameter
The program must accept an integer Q as the input. If the value of Q is 1, then the radius of a circle is passed as the input. 
If the value of Q is 2, then the diameter of a circle is passed as the input. 
The program must print the area of the circle with the precision up to 2 decimal places as the output.

Your task is to fill in the missing lines of code in the class Circle so that the program runs successfully.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1
5

Output:
78.57

Explanation:
Here the value of Q is 1 and the radius of a circle is 5.
The area of the circle with the precision up to 2 decimal places is 78.57 ((22/7) * 5 * 5).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2
7.5

Output:
44.20
