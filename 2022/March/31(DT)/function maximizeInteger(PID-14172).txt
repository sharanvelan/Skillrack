The function/method maximizeInteger accepts four arguments - M, arr1, N and arr2.
The integer M represents the size of the integer array arr1. The integer N represents the size of the integer array arr2. Both arrays contain only digits.
The digits in the array arr1 represents an integer value X.
The function/method maximizeInteger must maximize the value of X by replacing its digits with the digits in the array arr2.
Your task is to implement the function maximizeInteger so that the program runs successfully.
IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.
Example
Input/Output 
1:
Input:
5
1 0 3 5 6
3
1 9 7
Output:
9 7 3 5 6
Explanation:
The value of M is 5 and the given 5 integers are 1, 0, 3, 5 and 6.
The value of N is 3 and the given 3 integers are 1, 9 and 7.
After replacing the digit 1 in the arr1 with the digit 9 from arr2, the array becomes 9 0 3 5 6.
After replacing the digit 0 in the arr1 with the digit 7 from arr2, the array becomes 9 7 3 5 6.
Example
Input/Output2:
Input:
6
8 9 1 2 6 2
4
4 4 4 4
Output:
8 9 4 4 6 4
