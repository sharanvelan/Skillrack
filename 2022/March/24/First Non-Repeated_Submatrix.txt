First Non-Repeated Submatrix
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The values of R and C are always divisible by K. The program must print the first non-repeated K*K submatrix in the given matrix as the output. If there is no such submatrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
4 <= R, C <= 50
2 <= K <= 25

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The R+2nd line contains K.

Output Format:
The first K lines contain the first non-repeated K*K submatrix in the given matrix or the first line contains -1.
