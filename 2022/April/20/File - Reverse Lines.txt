File - Reverse Lines
The program must accept a string S denoting the name of a text file and an integer N as the input. The program must read the first N lines from the given file. Then the program must print the N lines in reverse order as the output.

Note: The given file is always present in the same folder where the program executes.

Boundary Condition(s):
5 <= Length of S <= 20
1 <= N <= Number of lines in the file <= 100
1 <= Length of each line in the file <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains N.

Output Format:
The first N lines contain the first N lines of the given file in reverse order.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
input1.txt
5

Output:
rose
red
the
pluck
You

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and the input1.txt file is present in the same folder where the program executes and the file contains the following values.
You
pluck
the
red
rose
and
go
home

So the first 5 lines in the file are printed in reverse order.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
input2.txt
2

Output:
Dog
Lion

Explanation:
Here N = 2 and the input2.txt file is present in the same folder where the program executes and the file contains the following values.
Lion
Dog
Tiger
Elephant
Deer
Horse

So the first 2 lines in the file are printed in reverse order.
